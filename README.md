<h2>Background</h2>
This project was created to complete in BeaverHacks Spring 2024. The theme for this hackathon was "retro", so our team decided to create a low poly horror game where the user is in an abandoned office building, and must collect office supplies while being chased by killer beavers!

<h2>Inspiration</h2>
The retro theme of BeaverHacks Spring 2024 inspired us to create Beaver-Breakout, a nostalgic game reminiscent of the classic arcade games we grew up with. We wanted to evoke the same excitement and simplicity that defined early video games, while adding modern twists to keep it engaging.

<h2>What We Learned</h2>
Throughout the development of Beaver-Breakout, we gained valuable experience in game design and development using Unity. We learned how to implement player mechanics, manage game states, and create an immersive environment with shaders and animations. Additionally, we improved our skills in C# scripting and debugging complex interactions within the game.

<h2>How We Built the Project</h2>
We built Beaver-Breakout using Unity, a powerful game development platform. Here’s a breakdown of our process:

- Game Design: We started with brainstorming sessions to outline the game mechanics, objectives, and levels. We created wireframes and flowcharts to visualize the game flow.
- Development: Using C#, we scripted various components of the game such as player movement, collectibles, and obstacles. Key scripts include:
  - ChangeMaterialsShader.cs: Manages the visual effects of materials in the game.
  - ChasePlayer.cs: Implements the logic for enemies that chase the player.
  - Collectible.cs: Handles the behavior of collectible items.
  - EndZone.cs: Defines the winning condition when the player reaches the end zone.
  - GameManager.cs & GameOverManager.cs: Manages game states and transitions.
  - PlayerMovement.cs: Controls the player’s movement.
  - PlayerPoints.cs: Keeps track of the player’s score.
  - SceneSwitcher.cs: Manages transitions between different scenes.
  - StartupManager.cs: Initializes game settings.
  - TorchController.cs: Adds interactive elements with torches.
  - Art and Audio: We designed retro-style graphics and incorporated classic sound effects to enhance the nostalgic feel.
  - Testing and Debugging: Rigorous playtesting helped us identify and fix bugs, balance gameplay, and ensure a smooth user experience.

<h2>Challenges We Faced</h2>

- Balancing Difficulty: Creating levels that are challenging yet enjoyable for players of all skill levels was a significant challenge. We iterated multiple times to achieve the right balance.
- Integration of Components: Integrating various game components and ensuring they interact seamlessly was complex. We had to debug and refactor our code multiple times to resolve integration issues.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
Beaver-Breakout is a testament to our love for retro games and our commitment to learning and growth in game development. We hope players enjoy the nostalgic yet fresh experience we have created.
